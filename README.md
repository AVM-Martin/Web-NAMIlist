# :hibiscus: NAMIlist

This is a simple website that contains a list of [\*Namirin](https://twitter.com/namirin_2525)'s
**public-only** karaoke and cover songs. You can search the song (by its JP title, EN title,
artist name, or stream/video upload date) and click it to access the video (it will be redirected
to her youtube). Do not forget to support \*Namirin through [her patreon](https://www.patreon.com/namirin).



## Developer Notes

**:hibiscus: NAMIlist** is built with ReactJS + bootstrap and hosted on GH Pages. I spent
approx. 4 hours of coding and 6++ hours of data collection + data parsing, all by myself.
If you encounter any issues or have any suggestions, do not hesitate to contact me (AVM.Martin)
on [my twitter](https://twitter.com/AVM_Martin). Please contact me if you want to reuse this
website to host another vtuber karaoke setlists (as long as someone wants to collect and parse
all data by themselves).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
